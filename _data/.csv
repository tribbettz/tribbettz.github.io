Bio Inspired Design - MIT Media Lab,Software & Electrical Engineer,February 2013,May 2013,"<br>&emsp;Imagine a worm wrapped in a cocoon of silk: protected, safe, secure. Almost two kilometers of silk are woven into a predetermined structure intrinsic to the worm. Now imagine several thousands of worms spinning silk into one very large cocoon-like structure. We did this to create a pavilion made of silk, built by worms, to demonstrate how natural processes can lend to architecture and design.<br><br>&emsp;My role was to design a system to track the worms in realtime as they spun silk. I designed and built an intelligent visual tracking system for small scale tracking and a harmonic radar system for large scale tracking.",medialab.png,medialab
RedStar Ventures - Vinely,Entrepreneur-in-Residence,May 2012,August 2012,"<br>&emsp;We all have tastes; tastes for art, tastes for fashion, tastes for food. We also have tastes for wine. Some like sweet tastes and others like fruity tastes. However, people are scared away by wine, thinking the learning curve is too steep. At Redstar, we sought to prove this was not the case.<br><br>&emsp;I developed algorithms to determine taste profiles based on preliminary data from in-person wine tasting parties. Through data manipulation, I was able to create a wine taste profile that piped into a custom built recommendation engine to present and recommend new wines to our users. Additionally, we would partner with local wine distributors and handle fulfillment.<br><br>&emsp;Originally named Winedora, we changed the name to Vinely. Check it out and sip some wine. Cheers!",redstar.png,redstar
