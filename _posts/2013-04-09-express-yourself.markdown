Friends, here marks the start of yet another attempt to better express myself in the blogosphere. In the past, I've always looked at the "blogging process" as work: something like homework or _something I have to do_. Consequently, my blogging lost its expressive nature.

I love expressing myself and there are so many different mediums of expression with which to do so. Pencils, crayons, paints, music, electronics, web - these are all examples of expressive mediums. I try to keep a variety of _expressive tools_ in my bag because I never know how I'm going to feel or how best to express a feeling. Blogging is just another _medium of expression_. By looking at the "blogging process" in this light, it becomes _something I want to do_, rather than _something I have to do_. 

Sit tight; the plot thickens...
