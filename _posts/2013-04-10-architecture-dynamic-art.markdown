"Architecture." What images does that word conjure up in your mind? For me, the word _architecture_ used to conjure images of ancient columns and turrets, linked together by a network of arches and bridges. It conjured up skyscrapers, cathedrals, and concert halls. It made me think of the MIT Stata Center. But there was so much more I was missing...

My travels backpacking through Europe supported my mental image of what I conceived to be _architecture_. I was surrounded by cathedrals and churches, castles and palaces, even Munich's famous Hofbr√§uhaus. But to me - at the time - they were just buildings. Some beautiful, some ugly, and all examples of architecture, but that's where my brain drew the line: it was something to be admired or appreciated, not something to be _experienced_...boy was I wrong!

Architecture - from what I'm currently experiencing - is not  designing buildings on blueprints nor is it matching _Doric_ columns with _Ionic_ columns (or not matching...?). Sure, those are tools in architecture but they do not represent it's essence. 

I'm experiencing architecture as a symphony, a painting, a rousing speech, and a beautiful performance. It's an art and I'll be damned if I don't experience it! And it is art... 

The art of buildings, the art of symphonies, the art of rhetoric or speech; but it is _functional_ art. Well perhaps not. All art could be considered functional. My mother keeps a coloring of a beach scene I drew for her when I was 5 years old and I believe it's functional (I may be biased). So how about we call it _dynamic_ art. I like that. Architecture is a _dynamic_ art: the art of designing _continuous experiences_.

My mother and sister recently saw the Titanic exhibit at the Franklin Institute (yup: Philly). Unfortunately, I was stuck in the frigid cold of Cambridge. It sounded amazing. It wasn't just an exhibit of things but rather an experience of things.

>When you walked in they handed you a ticket, recreated from the original ticket with a real passenger's name. After exploring re-creations of decks, dining rooms, and cabins, you got to The Wall. This is where you learned whether you - rather the name on the ticket - lived or died. You even got to touch an iceberg!

### Experiencing Architecture
I recently purchased a book called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Experiencing-Architecture-Steen-Eiler-Rasmussen/dp/0262680025' target='_BLANK'>_Experiencing Architecture_</a> by Steen Eiler Rasmussen. I suppose it's the inspiration for this post. It's a great read so far, describing the _rhythms_ and _harmonies_ in architecture. From the preface:

>My object is in all modesty to endeavor to explain the instrument the architect plays on, to show what a great range it has and thereby awaken the senses to its music.

I like this sentence because my senses are slowly waking up. I'm reflecting on my past experiences and realizing that, although I didn't know it at the time, I was _experiencing architecture_. Let me take you back to Europe with me, back to Versailles. It was cold, it was January, but walking through the gardens I experienced the beauty and the design of it all. When I got far enough into the gardens, away from the palace, and looked up, it inspired thoughts of a stairway to heaven, with my man Louis' crib as the House of God. 

Currently I'm building a harmonic radar system for a lab project and to go from knowing nothing about radar to building one, I believe I can call myself a Rad-Architect (lolz); I'm designing a radar system to _experience_ something. 

It's interesting to think that we are all mini-architects of our own worlds, having the power to design experiences, both good and bad. For whatever it's worth, it's something to think about...
