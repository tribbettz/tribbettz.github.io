"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears." A canonical line said by one of history's most courageous individuals and one literature's most cunning characters: Mark Antony. I recently had the honor of playing the role of Mark Antony in this Spring's MIT Shakespeare Ensemble production of _Julius Caesar_.

I first read the play during my sophomore year of high school and immediately fell in love with Antony's character. His character inspired me to learn more about the man, himself. Shakespeare took very little creative license in writing Antony; unlike many of his other characters, Bill kept Antony's essence true to the histories. This drew me even more to both Mark Antony and _Julius Caesar_. Once I began to act in theatre, I wanted to play the part of Mark Antony; I would have killed for that role. 

Luckily, I didn't have to kill anyone....

I auditioned and received the part of Mark Antony. I was elated. It was a wonderful show and it was a growing experience for me. I really pushed myself and I honestly think that I have grown as both an actor and a person from this performance.

After the final show, basking in the wonder of it all, we had our final cast party. It went on until after dawn, and on my way back home, in whatever stupor that sleep deprivation, pride, and alcohol can cause, I wrote an entry into my notebook. Rather than looking back and trying to explain my feelings and thoughts, I'm going to quote that previous version of myself, immediately after this whole _acting experience_.

This was written just after dawn, after the final performance and final cast party on March 24, 2013 in the MIT student center. 


>Basking in the blissful splendor of self-appreciation, satisfaction, and [screw] it: Pride, I sit here, now, on red plastic cushions, opposed by a red tardis - empty, but ready. Tonight, or rather this still morning's last-night, Zachary Tribbett became but a memory, a lifeless, static, crystallized idea. At the same time Mark Antony - or what some 23 year old shell of a man perceived as Mark Antony - manifested...

>I don't know if it was a culmination of events that catalyzed this or if I was revved up or if Antony himself spoke through me; whatever it was: it was most certainly a feeling. I felt it: It. I was the scene. I was the moment. I destroyed the constructs of "acting," demolished the set, broke beyond the audience, and became the character, became him - him that I would have killed to play: Mark Antony.

>I don't know why I love him, admire him. I was in the 10th grade when I read it and I didn't know the world. I hadn't experienced Time yet... I guess he was someone I wanted to be: smart, cunning, honorable, genuine, and true. Even still - I didn't really know what those words meant... I still may not.

>I broke through something today. I cried "CAESAR!" with the commons because I needed too, I wanted too, I had too. I felt it: that moment whatever it was...and I consciously accepted and reacted to that feeling to build, to create, to establish, to act, and to seduce the audience into me - my character - in whatever regard. This matters. Reflect on it.

>I did it. It's over. And it was memorable. I am proud, I am happy, and I am satisfied.

That's it. Hope you enjoyed the read. If you're interested, there is a [cast list](http://ensemble.scripts.mit.edu/shows/show.php?season=2013S) and a [video of the final show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWqjs8f0dBU). 

Remember, everyone is an actor, the world a stage, the people the cast, and your life: the performance. So break legs, act well, and know that you are the writer of your life. __Make it wonderful! Make it grand!__

_All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts_... - William Shakespeare, _As You Like It_
