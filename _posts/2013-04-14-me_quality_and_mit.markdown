_Quality_ has been a popular subject in my <a href='http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/90376' target='_BLANK'>_Affect: Biological, Psychological, and Social Aspects of "Feelings"_</a>* class this semester. Not just the quality of a product, or a building, or a piece of art, but also the _quality of the abstract_. By _quality of the abstract_ I mean things that are difficult to “objectify” or “define,” like the _quality of life_ or the _quality of education_. Up to this point, I’ve attributed the measurement of quality to objects, products, and things. I’ve now learned that those few categories are only a subset of what can be qualitatively measured. Consequently, I’m measuring the quality of most aspects of my life.

My education at MIT has elements of quality - _quality of the abstract_. It’s interesting because there are many “College Ranking” systems and MIT is usually high in these rankings. I’m sure there are a variety of metrics used to rank colleges but many - if not, all - of these rankings are based on _quantitative_ metrics, not _qualitative_. This makes sense because quality is hard to measure; it’s subjective. But that doesn’t mean quality doesn’t exist at MIT. I believe MIT is thoughtful in creating an education that is _high quality_.

During my time at MIT I have been exposed to various curriculums, departments, classes, professors, administrators, students, labs, living groups, clubs, and ways of thinking. Despite different _implementations_ of quality, all of my MIT experiences have emphasized the _striving for quality_. It’s not enough to get something done because it must be done well. I think that’s a big part of what makes MIT different than many other schools and organizations: MIT-ers aren’t just expected to get things done, they are expected to strive for quality and get things done _well_. 

Again, quality is subjective. For some, “striving for quality” might mean getting a program to run faster, or a circuit to use less power, or a mechanism to look prettier. There is no “one” definition for quality - especially at MIT. And MIT knows that quality is subjective; as a result they emphasize the _quality potential_; what is possible in striving for quality.

For me, MIT has done a pretty good job at teaching me how to look for quality and how to define quality for myself. Interestingly, how I look for quality and how I define quality are constantly changing. The more I learn, the more I reflect, the more I think all contribute to how I see and define quality in my life, my world, and my universe. I want to live a life of high quality and I am constantly trying to raise my quality of life, liberty, and happiness. MIT and all of its associations have been a great influence in helping me strive for quality, both in the _quality of things_ and _quality of the abstract_.
