We've all been in situations where the awkwardness was palpable; situations where we could feel _bad vibes_. We've also been in situations that were harmonious and serene; situations where we could feel _good vibes_. These phrases - _good vibes_ and _bad vibes_ - represent something fundamental to human feelings: _vibrations_. Well, not _vibrations_ per se, but _waves_, specifically brain waves that  propagate from the brain at various _frequencies_ - various _vibrations_. Everything we do, every interaction we have, _influences_ or _is influenced_ by these _waves_.

__So here's a question:__ Can we _predict_ emotional, mental, and physical responses to various stimuli based on brain wave readings? Additionally, can we _influence_ emotional, mental, and physical responses via brain wave manipulation? My hypothesis: _Absolutely_.

<!-- more -->

It's an interesting question and I believe - to some degree - it's completely possible to not only predict responses but also influence and manipulate those responses. 

I got the idea a few weeks ago when a friend and I were trying to understand a circuit schematic. We were trying to grasp the effect of a variable resistor on voltage up-ramp time. As I began to understand the relationship, a pleasant feeling of _calm_ took hold of me; I had reached a new level of understanding. And as I further grasped the relationship, my friend did too. 

At first glance there might not be anything special about this event. However, peeling back the surface of this experience reveals something curious: the possibility of unseen influences in communication and interaction. After thinking about it, I hypothesized that those _unseen influences_ are probably brain waves. 

Okay that's great but how can I test this hypothesis? How can I measure brain waves? 

I've been thinking about these questions a lot. The first problem is figuring out how to measure brain waves. My friend Larisa recommended using <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography' target='_BLANK'>Electroencephalography</a> (EEG) which measures _voltage fluctuations_ within neurons of the brain. These fluctuations have _frequencies_ (vibrations) which generate brain waves. Awesome! Now I have way to measure brain waves. But how can I test if it's possible to predict responses to stimuli from the recorded brain wave data?

__So here's an idea:__ With EEG I can measure the brain waves of a test subject under various experimental conditions. I can measure the brain waves generated in a relaxed state, an excited state, a state influenced by music or food or smell, and other various emotional, mental, and physical states. If my hypothesis is correct, then the more _conditional states_ I measure, the better I'd be able to predict a test subject's response to a _newly_ given stimulus. 

For example, if I measure your brain waves while you listen to various Led Zeppelin songs, I should be able to form a _model_ of your brain to predict how you would respond to _newly_ played Led Zeppelin songs. So if your brain gives off _waves of happiness_ whilst listening to _Stairway to Heaven_ or _Kashmir_, I would be able to predict that your brain will give off similar waves if I play _When the Levee Breaks_. Taking it one step further, if I know Led Zeppelin puts you in a _happy_ state, and you are currently in an _unhappy_ state, I could play Led Zeppelin to _influence_ your behavior and put you in a _happy_ state. A simple example but I hope it helps to explain the experiment to test my hypothesis. 

I think it's a cool idea and it's something I want to learn more about. The possibility is fascinating: with a better understanding of these _neural oscillations_ (brain waves), we can make strides in creating Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), understanding Cognition and Information Encoding, and curing brain disorders like Parkinson's and Epilepsy.

Remember Dr. Seuss' <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Oh-Places-Youll-Dr-Seuss/dp/0679805273' target='_BLANK'>_Oh, the Places You'll Go_</a>? There is a phrase: "Kid, you'll move mountains!" and I've always interpreted this phrase in the metaphorical sense. But after researching the potential of what these _brain waves_ can do, I'm reminded of something my dad used to tell me when I was younger: "Eventually, Man will be able to move a mountain with one thought." I was too young to appreciate my dad's innovative thinking at the time, but now I'm beginning to see its worth and possibility. 

Think about it for a while. And next time you're out and about, try and put out some good vibes; the world could use some more good vibrations.
