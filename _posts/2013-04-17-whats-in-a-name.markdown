I got to thinking about _Perspective_ and I began to see, or at least formulate, my place in the universe; my place in the _grand scheme_ of things. I jotted down a quick thought to the question "What's in my name: Zach Tribbett?" This is my attempt at an answer...

>I am the Zach you are experiencing. Different than the Zach you experienced and different, still, then the Zach you will experience. I am the here and now. I am a part of the world; dynamic as the world. I exist as a mass of atoms, constantly interchanging electrons - both internally and externally - originating out of the primordial ooze of solar excrement. I am the product of both cellular reproduction and human conquest. I am a fusion of gametes, satiating the sexual hunger of humankind. I exist to perpetuate my own existence. I am both the product of myself and the foundation for myself. I am a reflection of my world; a reflection of people and experience. I am Time. I am the Past. I am the Future. I am Zachary Tribbett. I am a Human being. I am the World. I am the Universe.

Where do you fit in the universe? Where are you from? Where are you going? What are you made of? What's in your name? Go ahead, indulge in philosophizing. ;)
