I'm reading a book called _A Laboratory Manual of Research Methods in Electrophysiology_ and there is a quote I want to share from the beginning of the section on _Brain Potentials and Rhythms_, stated by Sir <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_S._Sherrington' target='_BLANK'>Charles Sherrington</a>, a Nobel prize winning neurophysiologist. 

>The brain is an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one; a shifting harmony of subpatterns.
>
> -Sir Charles Sherrington, Man on his nature (1942)

I found this description thoughtful and beautiful. I hope you do, too.
