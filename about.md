<div class="text-center">
    <p>A Romantic. A Cook. A Musician. An Engineer. An MIT Alumnus. An Engineering Show Contestant. An Outdoorsman. A Photographer. A Brewer. And An Apsiring Humanist, happily finding his place in the world.</p>
    
    <p>The universe is full of wonder and awe - and it’s not a matter of knowing where to look; it’s a matter of knowing how to look.</p>
    
    <p>Get looking...</p>
